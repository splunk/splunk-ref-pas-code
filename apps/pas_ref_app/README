SPLUNK REFERENCE APP - PLUGGABLE AUDITING SYSTEM (PAS)
Version 1.0.1

RELEASE NOTES

(The most up-to-date version of the release notes is available online:
https://github.com/splunk/splunk-ref-pas-code/blob/master/README.md)

Splunk Enterprise is an analytic environment that uses a distributed map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search, and process very large time-varying data sets.

The Splunk Developer Platform enables developers to take advantage of the same underlying technologies that power the core product to build exciting new apps and solutions that are enabled by capabilities unique to Splunk Enterprise.

The Splunk Reference App - PAS teaches you how to develop apps for Splunk. On GitHub (https://github.com/splunk/splunk-ref-pas-code/), you can explore the evolution of the reference app along with some additional engineering artifacts, like tests, deployment considerations, and tradeoff discussions.

The accompanying Splunk Developer Guide for Building Apps presents a documentary of how the team went about building this reference app. The guide is currently available as an early preview at http://splunk.github.io/splunk-dev-guide. We welcome your feedback on both the app and the guide.


WHAT DOES THIS APP DO?
======================

The PAS app is intended to enable an organization to monitor various document repositories (current and future). Managers and auditors can use the app to see who has viewed, modified, deleted, or downloaded documents or other artifacts from various sources.


REQUIREMENTS/INSTALLATION
=========================

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Reference App - PAS.

1. Install Splunk Enterprise
----------------------------

If you haven't already installed Splunk Enterprise, download it at http://www.splunk.com/download. For more information about installing and running Splunk Enterprise and system requirements, see the Installation Manual (http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Installation).

2. Install the main PAS app
---------------------------

Install or symlink the main app (pas_ref_app) to the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps folder. For linking use the ln command on Unix/MacOS or the mklink command on Windows.

3. Get your data in
-------------------

There are several ways for you to feed data into the PAS app.

Ingest your own data. Just make sure those sources are tagged with "change" and "audit",

Use the eventgen app, if you want a simulated data flow. Get it from http://bit.ly/splunkeventgen, or

Consume the test data set provided in the test repo (http://github.com/splunk/splunk-ref-pas-test/tree/master/tests/pas_sample_data).

4. Install dependencies
-----------------------

The reference app relies on data provider add-ons. Three simulated data providers (file add-on, documents app add-on, database add-on) and one real data provider (Google Drive Data Provider add-on) are made available. Install at least one data provider. You'll find the install scripts for Unix/MacOS and Windows in the /bin folder. For the Google Drive data provider installation and configuration, see specific instructions in the googledrive_addon/README folder.

The reference app uses a lookup table which could have been produced by an HR system process. For demonstration purposes, we have encapsulated it in the pas_hr_info add-on.

(Optional) Certain reference app functionality requires an identity provider. We have used a simulated identity provider (https://github.com/splunk/pas-pas-ri-test/tree/master/pas_simulated_users_addon).

5. Configure user access
------------------------

Create a new user that belongs to the pasadmin or pasuser role, and log in as this new user. 

Alternatively, add index 'pas' to the default searchable indexes by going to Splunk Settings -> Access controls -> Role -> admin -> Indexes searched by default and adding 'pas' into the list of default search indexes.

Note: if you are using a Splunk Free license, integrated role-based access control is not available. Thus, you will not be able to add new users or roles and should use the alternative method of adding the pas to the list of indexes searched by default.


6. Configure the app using the Setup page
-----------------------------------------

Specify at least one department that you want to surface on the Summary dashboard.


USAGE
